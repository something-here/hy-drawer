**hy-drawer** can be used in a variety of ways:
* As **Vanilla** JavaScript class
* As **jQuery** plugin
* As **WebComponent**, both as *ES6 Module* and *HTML Import*
* Possibly as part of your own component hierarchy via [ES6 Mixin][esmixins].

The component was initially developed --- and can be encountered in the wild ---
as part of the [Hydejack](https://qwtel.com/hydejack/) Jekyll theme.

**NOTE**: The current version is a custom build for Hydejack, which works fine but assumes that you don't do certain "evil" things,
like detaching and re-attaching it to the DOM, etc. This will be fixed in the 1.0.0 release.

## Source
The source code is written in a *literal programming* style, and should be reasonably approachable.
However, some knowledge of [RxJS] is required.

The core functionality is implemented in [`mixin / index.js`](doc/source/mixin/index.md),
which is used to create the framework-specific versions of the component.
